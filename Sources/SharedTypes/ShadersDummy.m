// This dummy .m file ensures that the Swift Package Manager
// correctly builds the "NoisePlanetGeneratorShaders" target as a C-family
// language target, which helps Xcode find and compile the .metal files
// into a default.metallib that can be linked by the "NoisePlanetGenerator"
// Swift target or used directly by an application.

// No actual code is needed here.
